> Jeanette says: _"My son Harry signed up to do Maths with Michael and this has been a success story. Not only does Harry love the lessons and Michael's style of teaching but he has exceeded my expectations. We chose Michael as he could deliver at the highest standard and he was happy to help with dipping into other subjects (e.g. English) if that was needed. It has certainly paid off. Thank you for being so brilliant and helping my son to build his self-esteem._ 

> Tino says: _"His lessons are very educating and engaging. I recently had a science test and after doing lessons with Michael, my daughter got a grade 7 which I'm very pleased with. He's so nice and a great tutor!"_

> India says: _"Michael was always punctual and flexible with timing which was helpful. He helped my childen understand complex topics they struggled with the most and always made lessons very enjoyable. Highly recomommended"_
